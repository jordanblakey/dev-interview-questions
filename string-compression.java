/*
Given a string, write a function to compress it by shortening every sequence of the same character to that character followed by the number of repetitions. If the compressed string is longer than the original, you should return the original string.

e.g.

compress("a") = a
compress("aaa") = a3
compress("aaabbb") = a3b3
compress("aaabccc") = a3b1c3
*/

public String compress(String s) {
  String out = "";
  int sum = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < s.length() - 1; i++){
    
  }
}
